Everybody talks about omnichannel retail strategy as if it’s the Holy Grail. It’s meant to integrate all available channels in a consistent and seamless shopping experience for the consumer, but a growing number of global CEOs have told us that it’s unsustainable.
 
No one has the money or the time to make it work. That’s why organizations should stop pursuing omnichannel for the sake of it and move to an optichannel strategy, where they optimize their touch points based on where their customers are.
 
In the course of our marketing work in both business and academia, and particularly since we wrote the books “Retail 4.0” and “Onlife Fashion”, we’ve heard from numerous business leaders that omnichannel is not working for their organizations.
 
No wonder – omnichannel is virtually impossible in such a volatile retail market. People’s attention span is the shortest it’s ever been, and it’s highly fragmented. In just a minute on the internet, people send 197 million emails, upload 500 hours of YouTube content, send 200,000 tweets, and 1.4 million of them are scrolling through Facebook.
 
Large, established organizations struggle with omnichannel due to lack of operational agility. Because they’re less agile it takes more time to react and change. But in this exponentially accelerated world, sales and communication touch points keep evolving at the speed of an algorithm.
 
It’s also vital for companies to reach a critical threshold when committing to a particular channel – if they spread themselves too thin, they don’t reach enough customers in a relevant way. They need to master the specific rules of every touch point, share the right type of content that moves their audience, and invest enough media money to cut through the noise.
 
And then there’s the fact that many established organizations are overmanaged and underled. They have consolidated processes designed to achieve economies of scale, metrics and KPIs to track progress, and managers trained to defend stability. But they lack a digitally mature leadership to drive the necessary organizational shift.
 
Old-school managers were trained to go through an exploration phase in order to reach a long-lasting exploitation phase, where they could make the most of their competitive advantage. Now, due to the democratization of technology, the exploitation phase is shorter and the competitive advantage is transient.
 
So there needs to be continuous improvement, and an organizational ambidexterity that means companies are exploring and exploiting at the same time. As Marco Bizzarri, CEO of Gucci, told us: “Established companies always incur the risk of sitting back, repeating what they know and what has worked in the past, getting entangled in the bureaucracy of processes. And this is contrary to a world in which it is essential to remain dynamic and reinvent oneself continuously.”
 
If established organizations have the money and desire to embrace this new mindset, they can either hire and empower new-generation leaders, or upskill their existing board so that they accept that change is the only constant. They need to be prepared to learn, unlearn, then relearn.
 

Smaller, digital-native firms often surpass bigger companies at having a presence on the channels that matter to their customers, and making those customers happy. A nimble startup can harness technology and go from being invisible to a giant in its industry in a matter of months. If larger organizations don’t spot and invest in these opportunities, it’s hard to catch up later.
 
How to move to optichannel

Managers need to define their customer personas, analyze the customer journey, and carefully prioritize a new mix of touch points based on what their customers want and what the company can actually achieve and sustain.
 
And remember that customers don’t see channels, they see brands. If a customer orders a pair of shoes from your website and they don’t fit, they might take them back to the store. But then the salesperson tells them: “You can’t return these in person, because you bought them online.” You’re going to lose your customer’s confidence in your brand: if you don’t optimize your channels, you create friction.
 
Before optimizing channels, organizations must consider the following questions:
 
What are the touch points that make sense for our customers’ behavior?
Do we have an internal team with the right skills who can take care of all these touch points?
Do we have the budget to hire the talent we’re lacking?
Do we have the marketing budget to hire an external agency to do it on our behalf?
Do we have the media budget to reach the critical threshold to ensure that we can deliver relevant content to the right people at the right time?
Are we credible as a brand to join these touch points, or do we risk a ‘boomerang effect’ if we’re seen as inauthentic?
 
To succeed in optichannel retail, organizations need the right combination of high tech and high touch. Yes, they need the technology to process and analyze large amounts of data at the back-end, but they also need humans at the front-end to give it meaning. This is a precise and strategic activity, rather than one manager’s gut feeling about young people liking TikTok. The only way for organizations to narrow down the number of channels they focus on is to really understand what their customers want and need, and from that infer the best optimization of their retail strategy.
 

Post-Digital: When Hype Meets Reality

Despite the fact that various cataclysms—such as wars, natural disasters, and, indeed, pandemics—have shaped the human experience over time, more often than not we assisted to progressive transformations. In other words, the future is built with the past, not on the past. For example, although we use far less paper than we did before digitization, paper books, newspapers, and magazines are still widely used. Though streaming and cloud storage is the new normal, many still store files in physical devices, and record companies still release DVDs and even vinyl. Yes, e-commerce is growing steadily, but brick-and-mortar stores will always exist. In other words, as new products and formats find their footing, the once-dominant formats lose relevance, but they don’t disappear overnight—or at all. 

Though when we say ours is a “post-digital” age, that doesn’t mean we’re entering an era where everything we know about digital will be surpassed by something different. We use this term to refer to the beginning of a maturity phase: where hype meets reality. One in which people, institutions, and companies develop a more mature relationship with what was previously seen (even just a couple of decades earlier) as a disruptive technological revolution. In the post-digital age, we take that disruption for granted—and focus on the creation of a new reality.

Needless to say, the COVID-19 pandemic globally accelerated this transition. Businesses and markets alike were forced to adapt to restricted mobility and hence relied (even) more heavily on digital. And many reluctant companies were forced to stop procrastinating and engage in drastic digitalization to avoid going out of business. At the beginning of 2020, concepts like social commerce, voice commerce, and virtual reality were considered futuristic by many consumers; today, they are an integral part of the commerce fabric.

Of course this phenomenon is not new. Every time markets get disrupted by new technologies and competitors, the vast majority of legacy companies struggle to keep up. They are simply not prepared to leverage the same transformative innovation that the new players natively embrace. Azeem Azhar in the book The Exponential Age: How Accelerating Technology Is Leaving Us Behind and What to Do About It refers to the current version of this phenomenon as an “exponential gap,” the chasm between new forms of technology—along with the fresh approaches to business, work, politics, and civil society the technology brings about—and the corporations, employees, politics, and wider social norms that get left behind. The exponential pace at which technologies are being invented and scaled, all while they are decreasing in price and increasing in availability, exacerbates the gap and widens the gulf between tech and society. Our existing rules around market power, monopoly, competition, and tax became obsolete if not anachronistic vis-à-vis the gigantic size of ecosystem companies like Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, or Meta. Existing laws and employment practices don’t align with the new expectations of workers. The current structure of the market in many sectors, including retail, is such that both regulators and managers feel more inadequate than ever.

But, again, that’s nothing new; when a new paradigm arises, those prospering in the previous one have always needed to reinvent themselves to avoid extinction—whether we’re talking about the entire supply chain built around salt from when the Egyptians first used it to preserve food in 2000 BC or the twenty-two-century business of candlemaking being disrupted following the development of electricity. Information technology is a General Purpose Technology (GPT), which, as defined by economists Richard Lipsey and Kenneth Carlaw, can affect an entire economy and has the potential to drastically alter societies through its impact on pre-existing economic and social structures. Other examples include steam engines, railroads, cars, and, of course, computers.

Our assumption is that we are today at one of those crossroads that determines the beginning of a new era—one built with the previous one but also with the potential to lead to a very different scenario. The peculiarity is that contemporary GPTs are exponentially more powerful, hence their transformative impact might be astonishing.

In addition, these technologies are more prone to combination than are those of the past, which creates a mutually reinforcing cycle that will redefine the world as we know it. This brings us to the essential question: Given that the transformation triggered by the mix of these technologies is at this point the connecting tissue of the new normal, how can established companies, retailers, and consumer brands survive and thrive in a post-digital world?

We argue that we are beyond the hyperbolic initial phase where positions tend to be polarized—we’re entering the maturity stage. All the technological innovations described have been around for decades. It’s time for markets and companies to face reality and take a full inventory of this new era.

Maturity should also have led the business community to the full understanding that digital transformation is first and foremost a cultural shift. If companies want to properly achieve it, it is not enough to simply “digitalize” (to use a word processor instead of pen and paper and send emails instead of letters); they need to holistically embrace a new modus operandi. Based on our analysis of the most successful digital transformations of the past decade, as well as our hundreds of conversations with top executives worldwide, we conclude that the majority of this effort cannot be achieved through technology. Digital transformation must be effected by people. 

This means coaching, training, and upskilling and reskilling the workforce as an indispensable prerequisite, combined with reorganizing the reporting lines, reviewing the incentive structure, updating KPIs, and developing new ways of working. These are all necessary conditions to unlock the full potential of whatever technological innovation one hopes to bring to an organization. Technology is only as good as its weakest link, and its weakest link usually includes its users.

Finally, maturity means accepting that just because you can, that doesn’t mean you should. In some cases a complete digital transformation may not be the most suitable option, as some companies may lack the necessary resources to undertake a sustainable transformation. Perhaps they’re too small, or too siloed; perhaps their leadership isn’t entirely onboard or lacks the right mindset. In those cases, the solution simply sits somewhere else.

How We Got to Retail 5.0
Retail 5.0 will be enabled by the technological convergence described in the previous paragraph. But before we dig into the details of this new realm, let’s retrace the evolution of the previous four phases. To do this, we benefit from the framework offered in McKinsey & Company’s report “Retail 4.0: The Future of Retail Grocery in a Digital World,” written by Parag Desai, Ali Potia, and Brian Salsberg. And it’s important to keep in mind: although the different waves triggered a sequence of tectonic shifts in the world of retail, the new never replaced the old.

Retail 0.0: The Origins of Commerce
As noted earlier, we can argue that retail commerce was born in Mesopotamia in 6000 BC, when our ancestors started bartering or trading services or goods without using currency. Since then, many other civilizations all over the world adopted the practice, until it was replaced in most of the cases by money. The key elements of this phase are (1) the fact that the transaction requires that the parties physically meet to negotiate the value exchange (no fixed prices), (2) there being a certain information asymmetry between buyer and seller, and (3) the role played by the skills of the sellers—the more they emphasized the virtues of their products and services, and the more they personalized the transaction and forged relationships with their customers, the greater their maximization of value. This dynamic was the dominant form of trade all over the world until the beginning of the 20th century.

Retail 1.0: The Self-Service
You’ve no doubt seen shows or films where people acquired their goods not by milling through the aisles of a store but by naming the items they desired to the clerk behind the counter. With this setup the retailer is the center of the transaction. But in 1916, in Memphis, Tennessee, a new model was born—and patented in 1917—the self-service approach others have named “Retail 1.0.” According to the grocery retailer called Piggly Wiggly, “they were the first retailer to provide open shelves and checkout stands, and to price-mark every item in the store.” In this scenario, the information asymmetry between seller and buyer started fading and the retailer ceded center stage to the shopper. Components such as packaging and brand cachet increased their roles dramatically. Once the Piggly Wiggly Corporation franchised its model, the number of actual stores increased dramatically as well—from one to 2,500 nationwide by 1932. The format has since been adopted all over the world in virtually every sector, although in some cases with some variants.

Retail 2.0: “Everything Under One Roof”
We can argue that the following shift in the world of retail has been represented by the concentration of different shops under the same roof, often located in suburban areas to accommodate the huge footprint. Although the first shopping malls were built in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s, they boomed globally in the second half of that century, in some regions more swiftly than others. The main factors that facilitated the success of this format were the profusion of cars, which allowed people to reach remote locations and transport goods; the adoption of electricity, and thus refrigerators and freezers in which products could be preserved for longer time; and last but not least the growing number of women with full-time jobs, who needed to shop more efficiently than they had before. The combined effect of these variables drastically reduced foot traffic and purchase frequency, forcing a reckoning upon traditional local stores.

Retail 3.0: The Birth of E-Commerce
The next portion of our tale begins its disruption in 1994. At that time the Internet could be considered primordial—connecting approximately 40 million people with a maximum transfer rate of 56 kilobits per second, compared to the 5.1 billion online users who today enjoy speeds between 100 and 6,000 megabits per second. Into this realm stepped Jeff Bezos: who began selling books but today sells everything from AAA batteries to zip ties. Two of the most innovative features of this new model were low-cost or no-cost shipping and the “now-famous recommendation engine,” which McKinsey & Company see as being “as important to Amazon.com’s success as anything.” Fellow player eBay was founded in 1995; “by 1997 . . . ‘e-commerce’ had become a buzzword that ushered in a new era of retail”—one in which individuals could consider themselves “retailers” using a marketplace to sell goods to other individuals, and in which retailers’ roles in recommending their wares took yet another step back, its voice muffled by the buzz of peer recommendation.

Retail 4.0: Ubiquitous Commerce
We argue that Retail 4.0 starts approximately with the beginning of the new millennium and terminates with the COVID-19 global pandemic. This phase is marked by the progressive diffusion of feature phones before and smartphones later, combined with increasingly more powerful connections and technological infrastructure. In the first 20 years of this century, commerce has become ubiquitous, everyone can be a retailer, and every surface can be a store. Other characteristics of this phase are the consolidation of peer-to-peer commerce, the dematerialization of payments, the boom of e-commerce—including the adoption of D2C—and of course the hybridization between digital and physical stores in the so-called “phygital.” This period culminated in the lockdowns, which, three months into 2020, applied to nearly 4 billion people—roughly half of the world’s population. This confinement required even the most reluctant consumers to develop a digital literacy, and forced all retailers, manufacturers, and consumer brands to rapidly upgrade their digital skills. In that phase you could either sell online or you couldn’t sell at all. This caused an unforeseen acceleration that paved the way for a new era.

Retail 5.0: Post-Digital Commerce
We see several distinct angles regarding this next era.

One: In Retail 5.0, technology will be less visible but far more present. An array of minuscule sensors will collect and elaborate on real-time data about shoppers. Computers capable of seeing, hearing, and assessing the world around them will revolutionize the way brands and retailers communicate and sell, making every interaction contextually relevant and fully personalized to the single customer. To some extent, the relationship between supply and demand will resemble the tried-and-true model wherein sellers recognize and cater to individual customers. However, in this case the capacity of identifying customers and personalizing the experience will be powered by AI—and potentially scaled without limits. And, paradoxically, this mass personalization will be perceived as more rather than less human, since people will engage this technology using their bodies and voices rather than keyboards and screens. This aspect is part of a larger trend called “Zero UI” (Zero User Interface) whereby interactions with devices or systems happen more naturally and intuitively, often relying on voice commands, gestures, sensors, artificial intelligence, and  other forms of ambient computing. The goal is to make technology fade into the background, enabling users to interact with devices or systems as effortlessly as possible.  

Two: In Retail 5.0, organizations will recognize the wisdom of concentrating on the most relevant channels and touchpoints, optimizing resources rather than being lured into a state of “ubiquity” that risks fragmenting resources and diminishing effectiveness. The notion of omnipresence will yield to “opti-presence,” allowing organizations to avoid the paradox of choice, where an excess of options ultimately reduces the overall ability to make savvy choices. Emerging technologies will streamline this process, prompting players across industries to explore new ways of interacting with customers while meticulously measuring the return on investment. This will unlock new opportunities for both B2B and B2C brands, providing a significant boost to the aforementioned direct-to-consumer strategy.

Three: Companies will need to redefine the role of human beings—employees, store managers, sales associates, cashiers—in light of technology. Finding the right balance between what we should delegate to machines and what we should leave to humans will determine strategic positioning, competitive advantage and shape the customer experience. In the United States, the retail chain Trader Joe’s prefers its staff to stock stores during peak shopping hours so as to increase the chance they will interact with customers—and be on-hand to assist when needed. With this approach sales associates can humanize the shopping experience, optimize it, and potentially increase sales by making cross-selling suggestions.

Four: Another critical aspect that characterizes this fifth wave is the stable presence of virtual, immersive worlds in increasingly larger segments of the world population. As a consequence, our digital selves – including avatars – will become more important. People will spend increasingly more money on digital products and virtual experiences. And the customer journey will become in many cases three-dimensional: physical, digital, and virtual. B2Cization is set to advance even more, propelled by the growing accessibility of these technologies. And the 'C' in this scenario could represent a person, an avatar, or an AI, depending on the context.

Five: Moreover, just because something is not physical, it doesn’t mean it is less real. In Retail 5.0, digital is real, and virtual is real. Think about it: if we make a digital transaction, “real” money disappears from our “real” bank account. If we digitally sign a contract, or pass an exam during a video call, it has validity in the real world. 

What we write in an email we send into the digital sphere stands as a written agreement. If we play a video game online in the shape of an avatar with a friend located thousands of miles away, the way we behave has an impact on the relationship with that friend across all dimensions: real, digital, and virtual. If we buy an accessory for our virtual avatar by paying crypto money from our digital wallet, that money is as real as the digital product worn by the virtual avatar on the screen. 

And our analog brains connect with this concept; as much as 60% of consumers declare they would buy the same products for their avatars that they’d buy for themselves and for their avatars. We will further discuss the three-dimensional customer journey extensively in part II.

In summary, thriving in such challenging conditions requires a different mindset, new skills, and new guiding principles in order to rethink entire business models. There’s also no time to waste. Retailers with a “wait and see” approach will fall further behind.



3. The Direct-to-Consumer (D2C) Revolution: A Double-Edged Sword

To recap, there are pros and cons that need to be carefully scrutinized if considering shifting to the direct-to-consumer business model.
The pros of the D2C model include:
Potentially higher margins, since profit is not shared with intermediaries. 
Better control over sales funnels, customer experience, and brand identity.
More-efficient marketing investments (better targeting and retargeting) thanks to the first-party data about D2C customers.
Better demand-planning as a result of having a better understanding of consumer’s desires, needs, and preferences.
More-accurate feedback loops, which may enable a more-effective innovation process.
More transparent and authentic brand-customer relationships—potentially leading to increased brand loyalty.
Better inventory management (i.e., more efficient replenishment).
The cons of the D2C model include:
Losing the advantages of selling in bulk (including lower customer-acquisition cost, efficient financial planning, and the lower risks related to the stock produced), hence are more subject to demand volatility.
Needing to invest to develop new skills, and needing to hack the operating model (logistics, ICT, HR, marketing, sales) to construct one that enables D2C.
Jeopardizing the relationship with commercial partners in the transition from B2B to D2C.
Losing competitive advantage, since the best suppliers and retail partners could be contracted by competitors.

Experiential Benchmarks

Companies once “enjoyed” a landscape where they had only their direct competitors in their shared industry to stand out from—but that time has passed. Today’s customers are more demanding than ever, and so companies “need to be better than,” as McKinsey & Company puts it, “the [many] sources of inspiration who are setting the standards for your customer.”[1]
Once the bar of expectations of what is an “acceptable” delivery time or a satisfactory return policy gets set by the best-in-class players, who are often digital natives, all competitors, including established incumbents, must adapt. If they don’t, they are immediately perceived as obsolete and risk being neglected by even the most loyal customers. We call this mechanism “experiential benchmarks.” 

Of important note, once a new experiential benchmark has been set, it is virtually impossible that customers will thereafter consider suboptimal products, service, or experiences to be acceptable. And of course, in this era of widespread information, the chances of an unhappy customer leaving a negative online review are high.

A New Market Modus Operandi?

In the post-digital age of Retail 5.0, companies will define their business models and exploit their value proposition not by how they play against traditional industry peers, but by how effectively they cope with the standards that are continually redefined by markets and regulated by institutions. Furthermore, it will be increasingly important to educate customers on the dark side of experiential benchmarks so as to establish financially, socially, and environmentally sustainable best practices. These practices can become the new market modus operandi.

7. The Post-Digital Customer Journey

The customer journey has always been determined by personal, social, and cultural factors, “as well as being influenced, “by consumer motivation, perception, emotions, and memory. This, in turn, influences the customer buying process—a journey that entails the recognition of a need, a search for the best means to fulfill that need, and evaluation of the available options to finally arrive at the ultimate decision of what, when, where, and how much to buy, and how to pay for these purchases.”Due to the explosion of channels and touchpoints that we’ve experienced from the Retail 3.0 phase onward, and the unprecedented quantity of alternative products and services available, this journey has become far less linear and predictable than it was in the past. People still start the journey by recognizing a need or a want, later search for information to identify the “right” product or service, evaluate alternatives, decide whether or not to buy something applying the personal, social, and cultural filters, and finally—depending on the previous decisions—they experience certain post-purchase behaviors. However, the complexity is such that companies struggle to determine (1) what the most relevant interactions are, (2) how to influence the journey, and, as a consequence, (3) on which touchpoints they should allocate their media budget. Although most of the sales still happen in-store, the very concept of “point-of-sale” (POS) or “point-of-purchase” (POP) has become obsolete in a context where the transaction can virtually happen anywhere. The ubiquity of online and mobile tools means that people no longer view the brick-and-mortar store as a primary shopping destination—only as one of the many available touchpoints.

Traditionally, loyalty has been associated with the customer lifetime value and measured with metrics such as customer retention and repurchase rate. But in a connected world, loyalty must take into account the huge potential of people to advocate for a brand (or to destroy its reputation). The more people feel emotionally connected to a brand, the more they are inclined to partake in its initiatives, be loyal, and promote the brand itself. 

A Hybrid Journey
Another trait of the digital (and post-digital) world is the diffusion of hybrid purchasing and consumption behaviors. People are browsing on their smartphones while visiting a physical store or entrusting entire stages of the customer journey to digital only—to then pop into the store to try on a piece of clothing or check the quality of the fabric. Other people will prefer to begin the journey in a department store, then explore the websites of individual brands and perhaps complete the purchase on the site of a multi-brand e-tailer after reading reviews and making comparisons. We often use the terms “showrooming” and “webrooming” to describe, respectively, the practice of researching offline and purchasing online (showrooming), and the practice of researching offline and purchasing online (webrooming).

During Retail 4.0, digital and physical merged and fertilized each other in a permanent hybrid that has been defined by Professor Luciano Floridi as “onlife,” and gives the title to the fourth of our 10 guiding principles described in Part II. In our vision, if companies want to thrive in Retail 5.0 and fully embrace onlife, they need to seriously consider an additional dimension—the virtual world. Whether it’s in the realm of gaming, virtual reality, or one of the metaverses, the possibility for people to virtually interact with each other and with brands is here to stay, and will grow. Therefore, retailers and consumer brands should start considering a three-dimensional customer journey, where channels and touchpoints can be physical, digital, and virtual.

Interestingly enough, it turns out that the more time people spend in a virtual world in the shape of an avatar, the more their virtual self plays a role in their customer journey and can command specific buying decisions. According to the global marketing communications agency Wunderman Thompson, “60% of consumers would be interested in buying the same products for themselves and for their avatars.” And retailers from all over the world have tried to capitalize on this tendency.

It’s All Real
All these examples demonstrate that we are already witnessing a three-dimensional customer journey that seamlessly blends physical, digital, and virtual touchpoints where people can become part of the journey at any stage and from any point. As you might have noticed, we haven’t used the word “real” to describe the physical touchpoint. The reason is very simple—in the post-digital world, digital and virtual are as much real as the physical world itself. Of course, there are still relevant differences, but the more people embrace connected technologies and spend most of their active life online or in a virtual world, the more it’s becoming anachronistic to think of digital and virtual as not real.


Overall, virtual technologies have the potential to create a more engaging, convenient, and personalized customer journey, allowing companies to provide an optichannel, seamlessly integrated experience across all touchpoints. However, considering that there is a whole new world of touchpoints to be considered, retailers and consumer brands need to carefully develop a strategy that aligns customer expectations with their resources and goals.

Progressive companies are approaching the customer journey in a more holistic way, trying to see their customers in their full lives as multi-faceted, constantly evolving individuals who simultaneously play different roles every day. We will describe this approach in chapters 14 (Be Onlife) and 16 (Be Human) using the concept of customer personas (also known as “buyer personas” or “marketing personas”). They are fictional characters or, as Gartner Glossary defines them, “archetypal representations of existing subsets of your customer base who share similar goals, needs, expectations, behaviors, and motivation factors.”[15] They are built upon research, data, and insights and typically include demographics (age, gender, education, income, marital status), psychographics (belief system, interests, values), and behavioral traits (shopping habits, preferences, media consumption). The purpose of creating customer personas is to help businesses better understand their target audience and develop more effective marketing strategies.

We have often stressed the role that technology is playing in reshaping both the market landscape and customer behavior. One of the main challenges for retailer and consumer brands, therefore, is figuring out what portion of the customer journey should be delegated to technology and which activities should instead continue to be handled by humans. What is the balance between high tech and high touch? Let’s find out.


8. High Tech + High Touch

I’m a frequent flyer. One of those individuals who spends approximately 400 hours a year on an aeroplane. I interact the most with the flight attendants, who, despite their best efforts, invariably mispronounce my surname, which is quite hard to pronounce for non-Italians. But one day something remarkable happened. A gentle flight attendant, who was not Italian, greeted me by saying my name with an almost perfect pronunciation. 

That incredibly simple, warm moment made my day; it also made the seven-hour flight more agreeable, and strongly influenced my attitude toward not just the entire crew, but also the airline brand. So, how did she do that? She heavily relied on technology in advance, finding my name in the computer-generated passenger list, and perhaps consulting the internet to learn the correct pronunciation. 

She then heavily relied on her human skills: perhaps spending a few seconds practicing pronouncing my name, she put her tablet away before approaching me, looked into my eyes, greeted me, and smiled while offering me a glass of champagne—and my most memorable experience as a customer. To quote a chapter title from Marketing 5.0: machines are cool, but humans are warm.

We noted the significance of determining the ideal optimization of the customer journey. As Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen puts it in the Harvard Business Review, “We are now at the point where competitive advantage will derive from the ability to capture, analyze, and utilize personalized customer data at scale—and from the use of AI to understand, shape, customize, and optimize the customer journey.” He shared that Kroger is focusing on delivering “seamlessness and personalization.” Many retail giants—including Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase, Starbucks, and Nike—are doing the same.

With “high tech + high touch” we mean the harmony between seamless technology and the personalized, value-added human interaction that can create a perfectly balanced customer experience. 

But, as is often the case, there is no one-size-fits-all means of reaching that sweet spot. The perfect balance depends on various factors—ranging from the industry to the type of business to the digital alphabetization of the audience. But one helpful rule of thumb is knowing that it’s not always necessary to leverage technology every time. For example, chatbots are ideal for providing customers with quick answers to frequently asked questions—such as tracking shipments, store hours, or product availability. With these sorts of activities the value that can be added by a human employee is relatively low. The human value is much more pertinent in a brick-and-mortar store, or when the complexity of the transaction calls for a tailored approach, such as personalized recommendations or explanations of fine-print details—whether or not that human is interacting in person.

To reiterate, when personalization is informed by technology but performed by a person, its full potential is unleashed. A good example is the fitness app Future, defined by Wired as a “winning blend of old-school personal training and modern-day mobile technology.” Future is a fitness tech platform that collects and tracks users’ data related to their workouts, sleep, and other biometrics. The data is then analyzed by the platform’s proprietary algorithm to create a personalized workout plan, which is proposed to the user in combination with a certified personal trainer, who provides ongoing support, motivation, and guidance. Trainer and trainee are constantly in contact via the app, and can fine-tune the workout based on the individual’s needs and goals. Future thus demonstrates how game-changing the right combination of technology and human input can be.

We must ensure the combination is carefully managed. If, for example, a business decides to automate a phase in the journey in which the client would prefer to engage with a human—there is a big risk of creating friction that will upset the balance, sometimes with significant negative repercussions. (Those repercussions could be the loss of a single customer or, worse, “negative advocacy”—if that customer chooses to widely share their displeasure.) No doubt you’ve experienced the frustration of being forced to interact with a robot when what you need is a human to attend to your unique situation—the website with a buried (or nonexistent) “contact us” option, or the phone tree that stalls rather than immediately fulfilling your request to be connected to customer service. Companies would be wise to ensure that human interaction is available every time empathy, creativity, humor, out-of-the-box problem solving, ambiguity management, and other human-only capacities are called for. This human support can be vital to fixing a situation or even “just” enhancing a customer’s experience. Business leaders have the responsibility to understand what to deploy and when, leveraging data and their own emotional intelligence to understand what can best serve their customers’ need. As Greg Hoffman, keynote speaker, author, and former CMO of Nike, shared with us: “Data has given us more knowledge about our customers than we could have ever imagined. But, without applying the creativity that often resides in the right side of the brain, we are often left with creating solutions that only satisfy rational needs, not emotional ones. It takes both left and right-brain thinkers, working together to deliver the most meaningful value to our customers.[18]
We believe that in this post-digital age, the position that a company occupies on this ideal continuum—between fully analog and fully digital/virtual—will determine its ability to thrive. The distinction between what tasks technology should do and what tasks humans should do will be one of the most important differentiators to building brand personality.


As for what we already know: high tech and high touch clearly offer different benefits and drawbacks, depending on the combination of the two elements, creating both great opportunities and complex challenges for retailers and consumer brands.



High Tech
High Touch
PROS
Efficient: Technology can automate and scale many tasks and processes.
Emotional connection: High-touch enables a strong emotional connection between employees and customers.


Consistent: Technology can remove human discretion and ensure a consistent experience across the various channels.
Flexible: Humans are excellent at coming up with creative solutions to unexpected problems.


Personalized: Leveraging data, companies can deliver a personalized customer experience.
Personalized: A warm personal touch (even when informed by technology) can be a key differentiator for a business.
CONS
Impersonal: A lack of emotional connection can lead to customer complains.
Inefficient: Service quality depends on individual employees and can’t be standardized.


Expensive: The cost of building and maintaining a high-tech ecosystem can be prohibitive.
Inconsistent: People can’t continually deliver identical service.


Complex: High-tech ecosystems require complex system integration and skilled people.
Training: Employees need to constantly be trained, upskilled, and reskilled.

Table 8.1. The Pros and Cons of High Tech and High Touch.
We can conclude that, in a post-digital world, a brand value proposition is a function of:
the combination of high-tech and high-touch
the characteristics of the market
the experiential benchmarks that set the expectations of the audience
the traits of the customer personas that interact with the brand itself. 

Striking a balance between high tech and high touch can provide the best of both worlds and allow retailers and consumer brands to thrive.


Shopping Malls Apocalypse?
Shopping malls have been part of the retail landscape for decades. For many they offer a safe hub where people can shop for everything they need, get a haircut, pick up or drop off items for the drycleaner, or simply hang out with family and friends—maybe sharing a meal or watching a movie together. Malls are often considered the connective tissue of local communities, especially when they’re located far from urban areas.
But many malls, particularly in the US, have struggled to maintain their relevance in our high-tech era, largely because of changing consumer behavior and the rise of e-commerce. In fact, although brick-and-mortar stores still account for the lion’s share of consumer retail spending, many people today consider the idea of browsing in a giant mall obsolete—instead relying on digital channels to discover new products and services. Additionally, fewer people are inclined to concentrate all their shopping into one expedition to a more distant location, perhaps for reasons of having less time for errands in general—a trend that benefits smaller stores situated along work commutes.

Regional Differences
However, the decline of shopping malls is not uniform across all regions of the world. It’s also subject to several different factors, including population density, digital maturity, climate, purchasing power, availability of modern delivery services, local retail market dynamics, legislation, and trade context. In much of Europe, where people have a stronger culture of city centers, high streets, and independent retailers, the decline is relatively less pronounced—in part because there are fewer malls to begin with. For every one mall in Europe there were nearly 10 in the US. RegioData reports that, “in most Western European cities, the shopping center share reaches a maximum of 25%, while in CEE/SEE cities the value can easily be more than 50% of the total trading volume.” There are two notable exceptions: 

Scandinavia has a higher concentration of malls for reasons of both the weather and city centers being less retail-oriented; and Eastern Europe saw a high growth rate during its development phase following the breakdown of the communist system. 
But in various emerging economies in South America, Southeast Asia, China, or the Middle East, malls are still prospering, since they play a key modernizing role. 

Another reason why shopping malls are still relevant in some regions is the capability of mall stores to serve as a conduit with e-commerce—both fulfilling orders and accepting returns.

In many emerging economies the aforementioned modernizing effect of shopping malls has accelerated that development. For example, most of the malls in Asia have all been built in the last couple of decades. The Economist notes how, “until near the end of the 20th century, the region’s monumental architecture was dominated by imposing projections of imperial, communist, or newly minted post-colonial state power,” whereas today, “Asia’s glass-and-concrete malls sucking city dwellers indoors mark a huge architectural and cultural break.” Indeed, out of the world’s largest malls, eight are in Asia. One notable attraction is the fact that, in some of these locales, malls offer escape from unbearable weather conditions, especially heat. Based on our consulting experience, we’ve seen that China, Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, and the United Arab Emirates have recently experienced a boom in mall development. Of course, significant portions of Asia and Africa maintain the traditional retail formats, where street markets, bazaars, and mom-and-pop shops continue to dominate.

Beside the geographical peculiarities, we can argue that successful shopping malls in the post-digital era should extend their value proposition way beyond product distribution centers or places where people can casually browse. In fact, the most successful malls offer first-class entertainment, highly sought restaurants, and value-added services that are relevant for the local communities, including hosting meaningful events such as product launches, fashion shows, seasonal celebrations, live performances, workshops, festivals, children’s activities, and so on. 
Mixed-Use Developments

One challenger with the potential to mitigate or eliminate the effects of the trend described above is standard mixed-use development—a blend of commercial and residential real estate complemented by office space and useful services such as gyms and sport courts, food courts, even schools. This approach can play a significant role in stimulating the development of a remote community, especially in low-density countries. When well executed, these live-work-play environments have the potential to create efficient, virtually self-sustaining communities.

This is not the right place to discuss in depth the sociological implications of this dynamic, but it’s important to mention that these developments often become artificial self-contained enclaves for privileged people, oases that are completely detached from the outside world—where sometimes people live in very different life conditions. Of course, this gap is more pronounced in emerging economies and poor countries.

Ultimately, in our post-digital world—where experiential benchmarks command stellar customer-experience standards, and digital literacy and accessibility continues to mature in many economies—shopping malls will need to figure out innovative ways to blend physical, digital, and virtual in order to attract, engage, and retain the footfall that sustained them for so long.


The Perfect Storm

We opened Part I emphasizing the risks of both running backwards and allowing our experience of the past to guide our decisions about a fast-approaching future. We have argued that the world changes faster than our companies and institutions can adapt, and humans are more prone to defend the status quo than to forge unexplored paths outside their comfort zone. Therefore, the majority of established companies struggle to maintain their position vis-à-vis new-generation competitors and emerging technologies. Over the course of these chapters, we’ve focused on some of the most relevant challenges that retailers and brands currently face. 

But additional challenging elements need to be added to the discussion, including the macroeconomic headwinds that are impacting the retail industry from the outside in, and the inside-out dynamics that interact with those driving forces. In the next pages we will turn to these angles, although with a caveat: since the complexity of the global economy, combined with the disruption the retail industry is experiencing, could never be covered in one book, we offer a curated exploration.

The title of this final chapter of Part I came from a series of conversations we had in May 2023 with a flagship consumer brand Global Retail Director, who asked to remain anonymous. He explained that many retailers are today dealing with the perfect storm that has resulted from a convergence of unfavorable conditions, which we lay out here:
the spiral of constantly rising operational costs,
the debt many retailers accumulated both before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,
the toxic cocktail of recession plus the high interest rates that many economies face,
the supply chain’s disruption caused by lockdowns and wars,
a work environment where more and more employees work from home at least part time and
a generalized lack of personnel in the retail world due to more attractive alternatives, lower than average salaries, long working hours.

Rising operational costs are the result of some endogenous factors—such as risk-averse culture and siloed organizational structures—that led to the postponement of many strategic decisions that have become long overdue. For example, now that once-emerging technologies are an integral part of the competitive advantage of best-in-class players—the risk-averse retailers need to fork out high investment costs just to catch up. Additional endogenous factors include the chronic sub-optimal use of available consumer data; limited digital knowledge, skills, and capabilities; and a generally scarce collaboration culture.
There are also exogenous variables to be factored in. The most important is probably the exponential growth of digitally native players who have fully embraced digital transformation from a technological, operational, and cultural point of view. Take Amazon for example. The annual budget they allocated on R&D for 2022 was $73.213 billion, a 30.62% increase from 2021 ($56.052 billion), which was a 31.15% increase from 2020 ($42.74 billion), which had increased 18.95% from 2019. 

How many companies in the world can compete against this muscular power?
Among the external forces, a predominant role has also been played by an impressive series of black swans (as per the concept popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb: rare events that are virtually impossible to predict or foresee that have radically destabilized the global economic environment, including the attack on the Twin Towers in 2001, the global financial crisis in 2008, Brexit’s referendum in 2016, and the COVID-19 pandemic. 

But there is another exogenous dynamic that has continually come up during our conversations with retail and brands executives: the pressure inflicted by commercial landlords, especially for prime locations. In fact, many of the most sought-after retail locations on the high streets of the world’s commercial capitals are owned by large real estate developers or private equity firms who tend to apply, in the words of our anonymous interlocutor, “astronomical rates that are far from being sustainable for a brick-and-mortar flagship store.” These owners’ business model is built on the assumption that they will be able to pay back the debt they incurred to acquire a property with the future rent paid by the tenant—and they often use the property itself to back the debt. Due to the nature of this model, such companies must aim to maximize their returns on investment no matter what, and are driven by short-term financial results. 

As a consequence, the exorbitant rental rates of many of the top sites inevitably create a significant burden to retailers. This is even more painful in a mature e-commerce world where ever-changing consumer preferences force companies to constantly refresh their value proposition.

One last dynamic that’s worth mentioning is the fact that, for the first time in human history, there are five generations living, working, and consuming at the same time—Generation Z (born between 2001 and 2020); millennials (born between 1981 and 2000); Generation X (born between 1965 and 1980); Baby Boomers (born between 1946 and 1964); and the Silent Generation (born between 1925 and 1945). Inevitably, this coexistence of people with very different backgrounds and ambitions creates additional turbulence in the effort to understand customer personas and map the customer journey. 

For example, it is estimated that millennials and GenZ will make approximately 75% of the luxury spend by 2026. Brands must figure out new ways to engage with these segments, because they conceive “luxury” in a less materialistic way, are driven by a different set of values and, in many cases, have different  priorities compared to previous generations—including social and environmental sustainability, inclusiveness, equality, and gender fluidity. High-end product resale and rental are also relevant options for this cohort, which tends to research and engage with brands predominantly online and is more prone to embrace virtual technologies and augmented reality during the customer journey. Another example is the business opportunities for retailers and brands connected to a healthier and wealthier Silent Generation—ranging from mobility aids, health-care products, and personalized wellness solutions to tailored travel packages, guided tours, senior-friendly accommodations, and entertainment options.

The 10 BEs of Post-Digital Retail

The ten BEs that we believe should guide retailers and brands in a post-digital world are divided into two sub-groups. We define the first three as “overarching,” as they are related to the mental posture that every business leader and manager should embrace in such a volatile world.

Be Humbitious: a portmanteau of “humble” and “ambitious.” Humbitious leaders value vulnerability, possess the humility to acknowledge their limitations, learn from others, and recognize the value of collaboration. At the same time, they maintain a strong ambition to set goals, inspire others, pursue personal and professional growth, and make a positive impact on the world. They are convinced that pure humility may limit bold plans, whilst pure ambition may lead to hubris.

Be Purposeful: in an ever-changing complex world, understanding and expressing the true purpose of your company and its role in the world is a unique opportunity to build resilience, differentiate from competitors, attract, engage, and retain talents, foster stakeholder trust and nurture brand reputation.

Be Ambidextrous: inspired by the concept of “organizational ambidexterity” coined by Charles O’Reilly and Michael Tushman, we argue that business leaders and managers, especially in established businesses, should be able to effectively integrate two seemingly contradictory approaches: exploration and exploitation.

Be Onlife: Coined by Professor Luciano Floridi, the “onlife” concept highlights the blurring boundaries between digital and physical worlds. It recognizes that our online activities and digital footprint are intertwined with our offline experiences, relations, and behaviors. In the chapter, we argue that we should add a third variable to the equation, since virtual touchpoints are going to gain a lot of attention in the next few years, opening the way for a 3D customer journey.

Be Personal: Individuals are by definition attracted by personalization. It makes us feel unique and valuable. From a business standpoint, personalization allows companies to increase efficiency and effectiveness while also maximizing the likelihood of offering products, services, and experiences that are highly relevant for the users. Leveraging technology in this direction can be a game-changer, but the decisions to be made require a thorough assessment and consideration of complex trade-offs.

Be Human: While technology and automation are increasingly more pervasive, humans still play crucial roles that cannot be fully replaced by machines. Moving forward, understanding which activities should be automated or digitized versus which should be performed by humans will determine the unique proposition of a company—as well as create the conditions for its competitive advantage. Given the multitude of variables involved—including geography, industry, market conditions, digital maturity, and local culture—there is no single approach that fits all situations. Finding the right balance will require thoughtful consideration and case-by-case evaluation.

Be a Destination: The post-digital world is characterized by a fragmentation of touchpoints, and we are constantly inundated with stimuli urging us to try new products, services, and experiences. In this saturated environment there is limited space for merely transactional have-to-go touchpoints. And so it is crucial for brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce websites, content platforms, social networks, and all other touchpoints to be strategically designed and curated to captivate and engage people—and compel them to return.

Be Exponential: This concept is inspired by the book Exponential Organizations by Salim Ismail, Michael S. Malone, and Yuri van Geest. This type of organization leverages exponential technologies and strategies to achieve rapid growth and outperform traditional linear competitors. Exponential organizations are often structured in a decentralized way, relying on networks, platforms, and ecosystems. They leverage external resources to extend their capabilities and access a wide range of expertise.

Be Invisible: While technology is more ubiquitous with each passing day, it should always be seen as a means to an end; it should seamlessly integrate into our lives and experiences without drawing unnecessary attention to itself. Invisible technology is intuitive, effortless to use, and conducive to our daily routines.

Be Loyal: Companies should prioritize and act in the best interests of those invested in their success. This means their loyalty should extend beyond their shareholders to also include their stakeholders and customers. Every single link in the value chain includes direct and indirect third parties that should be not only taken into account, but also deserve loyalty. Note, since this vision is relatively new, and it might require a painful restructuring of the P&L, especially for legacy firms.



The Retailers of the Future Won’t Profit from Marking Up Products Prices

In the ever-evolving landscape of retail, the notion of profiting from product sales is becoming increasingly antiquated. Picture this: stores brimming with products, not to make a hefty profit from selling them, but to harvest the far more lucrative crop of customer data. Retailers are realizing that the real goldmine lies not in the margins of the products themselves but in the data and the advertising potential that their customer base represents.

Why is this relevant? Because it can build a high-growth, high-margin business model on the back of their low-growth, low-margin core business.

Why should retailers double down on it? Because retailers own a ton of first-party data. By combining observations of in-store customer behavior with customer responses on their digital platforms, they can become business intelligence powerhouses. This secures their spot as the best-placed player in the market to drive relevant advertising messages and promotions, compared to brands or the third-party advertising platforms brands typically rely on.

How much is the opportunity worth? A lot! McKinsey estimates that by 2026, retail media will add $1.3 trillion to enterprise values in the U.S. alone, with profit margins between 50% and 70%. To put this into perspective, consider that Amazon in 2023 earned $46.9 billion from advertising (primarily sponsored ads on its website). This figure exceeds the annual global revenue of Coca-Cola, making Amazon the third-largest advertising platform behind only Google and Meta.

It’s not surprising that in recent years, traditional retailers have tried to grab their share of the pie. In 2023, Walmart earned $3.4 billion from retail advertising, and Target and Instacart both earned more than $1 billion. All over the world, a wide array of established retailers including Dick’s Sporting Goods, Home Depot, Lowe’s, Macy’s, Ulta, Walgreens, MediaMarkt, Tesco, JD.com, and Rakuten have all explored this more lucrative revenue source.

Under the umbrella of retail media, we can include two macro categories:

The first one is FIRST-PARTY DATA MONETISATION across brick-and-mortar stores, digital signage, and both owned and paid digital channels. CVS and Tesco analyze purchase patterns to offer accurately targeted digital coupons through loyalty and rewards programs. The contextually relevant coupons are delivered on customers' smartphones when they are about to make purchases, increasing the conversion rate. These personalized promotions create a lucrative revenue stream from brands eager to reach specific customer segments. 

By linking online ads to offline sales, Walmart provides advertisers with unparalleled (anonymized) insights into consumer behavior, making their ad offerings highly attractive. Competing with Amazon, Walmart has also ventured into video advertising, showcasing personalized commercials via smart TVs and streaming services. In China, JD.com’s e-commerce platform integrates video ads into product listings and live streaming events, driving additional revenue through increased product visibility and promotional opportunities. Rakuten’s platform in Japan seamlessly blends shopping and entertainment by offering live streams of product demonstrations where customers can purchase items directly, providing a novel and engaging shopping experience.

The other macro category and revenue stream can be classified as N-STORE ADVERTISING. Walmart, for example, displays targeted ads on over 170,000 screens across its stores. Walmart leverages its first-party data to offer precisely measured and highly effective ad placements. This strategy has not only boosted their advertising revenue but also enhanced customer engagement. 

In Europe, MediaMarkt employs a similar strategy with digital screens promoting various electronics brands. This approach generates significant ad revenue and enhances the in-store shopping experience by providing relevant product information and promotions. Walgreens has explored this frontier by installing ad-filled digital screens on refrigerator cabinets in stores. Although initially faced with challenges, this concept highlights the potential of integrating interactive ads into physical retail environments.

So why are retailers not yet exploiting this El Dorado? Three reasons: Culture, Culture, Culture.

Understandably, most of them don’t see themselves in the business of monetizing data, but instead live in the marketing myopic bubble of seeing themselves as “resellers of products for a margin.” Most of their managers have not been trained to run a media platform. Inevitably, their internal processes and IT infrastructure lack the necessary capability to support this transition. On the other end of the spectrum, the situation is not that simple either. Internal conflicting priorities must be addressed.

As one of the largest global grocery retailers, the newly founded retail media department faced significant internal resistance when it proposed growing retail-media revenue. Seventy-five percent of the campaigns requested by brands in the first year of operations were blocked by merchants, who feared that increasing couponing budgets would reduce the retailer’s bargaining power in their annual trade negotiations with the brands.

However, retail’s future is multidimensional, with product sales becoming just one of many revenue streams. By embracing in-store digital ads, data monetization, video advertising, and interactive shopping experiences, forward-looking retailers are not only enhancing their margins but also revolutionizing customer engagement.

The retailer-manufacturer relationship is undergoing significant disruption, creating new sources of growth but also new challenges. Retailers and manufacturers that want to tap into this growth will have to rethink not only how they collaborate with each other but also how they organize and collaborate internally. This is expected to result in profound changes in the retail sector and provide growth and profit opportunities for firms that prepare their business now for the retail-media disruption. With retailers now building brands, the retailer-manufacturer relationship is fundamentally changing. To win in this new world, both sides will need to adjust their strategies quickly.

The retailers of the future won't profit from products—they'll profit from people. If McLuhan's adage holds true, and the medium is indeed the message, then the message of tomorrow will be intricately woven into the fabric of our shopping experiences across digital, physical, and virtual channels.

Forget B2B and B2C. The future will be B2Ai

Problem: Up to 1/5 of our time is dedicated to gathering information and dealing with routine tasks. 

Solution: Since we were hominids, we have been shaping tools to solve our problems and simplify our lives. Later, these tools have shaped our lives.

AI assistants will help consumers navigate their increasingly overwhelming number of choices. Every year people buy from thousands of product categories, deciding among dozens or hundreds of options in each. Even routine purchases can be time-consuming; nonroutine purchases often require sorting through the nuances of competing offers and are fraught with risk. While shopping for shoes may be fun, picking the right toothbrush from more than 200 products is pretty tedious. Choosing the wrong tennis racket can ruin your game, and buying an ill-considered cell phone plan or insurance policy can be costly.

AI assistants will not only minimize costs and risks for consumers but also offer them unprecedented convenience. They’ll ensure that routine purchases flow uninterrupted to households—just as water and electricity do now—and manage the complexity of more-involved shopping decisions by learning consumers’ criteria and optimizing whatever trade-offs people are willing to make (such as a higher price for more sustainability).

Consumers’ allegiance will shift from trusted brands to a trusted AI assistant.
The effects on the business landscape will be far-reaching. Technologies that revolutionize the way consumers interact with a marketplace also tend to reconfigure its dynamics and reshape the companies that sell into it. In the 1950s, for instance, the rise of supermarkets made scale and mass media much more important to marketers, triggering a wave of consolidation among consumer goods companies. AI platforms and assistants will likewise change the game for brands and retailers, altering the relative power of players in the value chain and the underlying basis of competition.

Most consumers will use only one, whose assistant will be incorporated into their homes, cars, and mobile devices. The platform will gather and deliver information, and the assistant will be the consumer’s interface with home systems, appliances, and other machines. The assistant will also be the portal to an infinite shopping mall of goods and services. The more consumers use a platform, the better it will understand their habits and preferences, and the better it will meet their needs—increasing their satisfaction in a self-reinforcing cycle.

Sophisticated AI platforms will go further and figure out the trade-offs consumers are willing to make: How much more will they pay for a more healthful product? How much room in a car will they sacrifice to get better fuel efficiency? AI platforms will even know whether consumers are likely to adapt their requirements in different contexts—for example, if a person on a diet will make an exception for dessert when celebrating. Because of all this, AI platforms will be able to predict what combination of Product, Price, Place, Promotion better works in each specific situation for each individual. 

Marketers’ current obsession with creating an omnichannel customer experience will fade as AI platforms become a powerful marketing medium, sales and distribution channel, and fulfillment and service center—all rolled into one. The concentration of those functions within a few platforms will give their owners enormous clout, and branded products will find themselves in a weaker position. Consumer companies that feel that large retailers like Walmart wield too much power today will be even more alarmed by the might of AI platforms. As a major—or even primary—means of communicating with consumers, and the repository of reams of data about their habits, preferences, and consumption, the platforms will have a lot of influence over prices and promotions and the consumer relationship itself.

Brands today owe their success to their ability to signal quality and win buyers’ loyalty. But in a world of AI platforms, marketers may find that consumers like Lori shift their allegiance from trusted brands to a trusted AI assistant. The activities that help brands cement relationships with buyers over time—understanding and filling people’s needs, assuring quality, and consistently putting consumers’ interests at the center—will in many cases be performed better by AI. In fact, we predict that AI assistants will win consumers’ trust and loyalty better than any previous marketing technology. We therefore expect the focus of many brands to shift from reinforcing direct relationships with consumers to optimizing their positions on AI platforms.

Ai to Ai. In the coming years the main target of the billions in annual spending on brand marketing will shift from forgetful, biased consumers to AI platforms that retain every last bit of information. Platforms will analyze that data, taking into account products’ pricing, characteristics, past performance, and reviews (weighted by authenticity and relevance) and the consumers’ preferences and past behavior. Customer acquisition will become even more of a science and will focus on a single channel—the platform—rather than on multiple channels.

In this universe, influencing the platforms’ algorithms will be the key to winning. In the first phase it will be crucial for companies to understand the customized purchasing criteria that the AI applies on behalf of each consumer. Sellers will probably have to pay platforms to get that information—and to be “listed” on them, in much the same way that brands now pay shelving fees to brick-and-mortar retailers. 

In a second phase companies will build their own AI agents designed to interact with their non-human counterparts. These artificial agents will interact with each other with the ideal objective of freeing our time from low added value activities. 

Ultimately, AI assistants may be able to satisfy customers’ needs better than the customers themselves can. Something that relatively primitive recommendation engines are already doing, suggesting books, movies, and music that consumers didn’t know they would enjoy.

The end of Branding as we know it. Marketers assume that repeat purchases indicate customer satisfaction and are a sign of brand loyalty. Yet many customers keep buying a product not because it delights them but because they can’t be bothered to explore alternatives if a brand is performing adequately. Put simply, most people have better things to do than evaluate the ingredients of laundry detergents. An AI assistant, however, does not. It can regularly reassess all brands in any category, whether laptops or chewing gum, and recommend a new one that might serve the consumer better. Some consumers may even like to switch things up just for the sake of variety—so their assistants, being aware of that, will periodically recommend new products they might like.

Check the concept of emotion AI (affective computing / empatetic AI interactions) che spingerà l’empatia oltre migliorando ulteriormente l’allineamento con i nostri bisogni e desideri. 

That routine reevaluation of purchases will force incumbent brands to constantly justify their positions. But it will also open opportunities for challengers. Competition will get more intense.

The secret to competitive differentiation—and, hence, retention—will be constantly designing offers that meet a customer’s evolving criteria. For brands, this will become as much a focus of innovation as developing better products is. 

The combination of this dynamic of continuous improvement with the the time the Ai Agents will give back to people has the potential to unlock a new era where humans will potentially reduce the time they dedicate to negotium (latin for the time we devote to activities different from resting and enjoying life) and increase the time we dedicate to otium. All with a huge potential increase in productivity, efficiency, and quality of life.

Any risk? AI platforms will succeed only if consumers have faith in them. As one platform leader at Google told us, “Building trust will be the most important thing we do.” To earn consumers’ confidence, platforms must ensure three things: accuracy, alignment, and privacy.

Accuracy: by continually learning each individual’s desires and requirements, the platform algorithms will hone their ability to please consumers. If a platform can recommend an alternative to a trusted brand that it thinks the consumer will like better, and the consumer is happier with the alternative, that platform will supplant the brand as the object of her trust.

Alignment: there’s a built-in conflict of interest that platforms must manage carefully. On one hand, they must single-mindedly focus on meeting consumers’ needs; if they fall short, it will erode trust. On the other hand, they’ll have contractual arrangements to provide preferred placements and consumer data to brands. If people sense that an assistant is pushing a paying brand that isn’t aligned with their needs, that too will undermine trust. One solution might be for platforms to be transparent about their relationships with brands, just as Google is today when it identifies some search results as ads. Another may be to give paid and unpaid recommendations equal weight; if a consumer asks an AI assistant how best to remove grass stains, the response might include both a paying bleach and a comment that generic bleaches can be just as effective. The brand gets its plug, and the assistant demonstrates that it’s trustworthy.

Privacy: platform owners, as well as marketers, will need to strike a careful balance between the use of personal information and AI performance. The more data gathered, the more accurate the platform—but the more exposed consumers may feel. A solution here could be to offer customized privacy settings, as Facebook now does, giving users control over what information they share and how widely. Another, less satisfactory solution might be to argue, as Google sometimes does, that privacy is protected because consumer data is handled by machines without human intervention.

Consumers have long been willing to give up personal information, and even privacy, for convenience. It’s a trading - I give you my time/attention/personal info and you give me fair value. AI assistants will offer much greater convenience but be far more intuitive and intrusive than any software now in use, greatly magnifying the trade-offs. Breaching privacy and failing to be trustworthy (e.g. manipulating customer behaviour) will be a major risk for platforms. Transparency and accountability (who is responsible for protecting user data) will be major areas of attention. 

All consumer-facing firms can expect AI platforms to radically alter their relationships with customers. Their traditionally crucial assets, such as manufacturing capability and brands, will become less central as consumers’ attention shifts to AI assistants, and the value of consumer data and AI’s predictive ability soar. Push marketing (getting platforms to carry and promote a product) will become more important, while pull marketing (persuading consumers to seek products) becomes less so. The consumer will remain the target of brand-building efforts, but marketing that encourages trial and repeat purchases will be more effective when aimed at AI. 

Though the marketplace will be more efficient, companies will encounter intense pressure to offer consumers the best deal—the one most closely aligned with the preferences identified by AI gatekeepers.

For a long time, consumer goods companies, used to maximizing economies of scale because of their large fixed investments in production and brands, have zeroed in on one strategic question: How much more of our product can we sell? 

AI platforms will present a very different opportunity: to maximize the depth of the relationship with the consumer by offering a wide range of products—in other words, economies of scope. Investments in building trust with consumers and their AI assistants will be amortized by asking, What else does this buyer need? Superior marketing strategy will still matter—firms must acquire, satisfy, and retain consumers in the AI world—but what it involves is likely to change substantially.

Recently, I had the privilege of sitting down with Seth Godin, a titan in the realms of marketing and retail.Our conversation delved into the future of these industries, exploring some of the guiding principles outlined in my latest book, Redefining Retail, co-authored with Professor Philip Kotler.

Now, I'm thrilled to share some of the most eye-opening moments from our chat with you! The landscape of marketing and retail has seen monumental shifts over the years, driven by lightning-fast technological advancements and evolving consumer behaviours.

While many still view marketing as mere promotion—getting the word out, making a splash—I beg to differ. Marketing, in its essence, is about storytelling and connecting with your audience. As Seth said, it's about crafting products and services that genuinely resonate with people and help them on their journey.

Gone are the days when marketing was synonymous with flashy advertisements and persuasive pitches. Today, it's all about forging genuine connections with customers, delivering value and delivering experiences that feel personal and authentic. Navigating the post-digital era.

In our hyper-connected world, the lines between physical, digital, and virtual spaces have faded, ushering in what we call the "post-digital" era.

Today, consumers seamlessly navigate between brick-and-mortar stores, online platforms, and virtual hangouts, expecting a seamless experience across all touchpoints.

So, how can retailers stand out? Clearly, just ‘going digital’ isn’t enough.

To keep up, they must adopt a holistic approach, integrating real life, digital world and virtual experience to create a smooth and engaging customer journey—one that sticks with customers long after they've left the store. In other words, retailers must be a destination.

Amidst a sea of choices and distractions, standing out requires offering more than just products or services. Whether it's through a physical storefront, an online platform, or a digital community, the aim is to create an irresistible destination that draws customers in and keeps them coming back for more.

Personalisation vs customisation

In a world buzzing with endless options, retailers may feel lost in the shuffle. But fear not, for there's a golden ticket to winning over customers: be personal. People crave recognition and individualised experiences, whether it's walking into a store and being greeted with their favourite order or receiving tailored recommendations online.

Careful though: let's not confuse personalisation with customisation. Customisation caters to group preferences, providing options that speak to a certain cluster of customers but lack uniqueness.

On the other hand, personalisation delves deeper, using data to craft custom-made experiences tailored to individual preferences and behaviours, ensuring a seamless, one-of-a-kind journey.

Seth came up with a really striking example here, though maybe a bit grim. Imagine you're at a funeral parlour. A tissue company might just see a group of people labelled "those who cry at funerals".

That’s customisation. But to truly connect, you need to recognise that each person is there for a unique reason, shedding tears for a specific loved one they had a “personal” relationship with.

Being personal means seeing each customer as an individual with their own story, quirks, and feelings, and making them feel truly understood. Now, technology plays a crucial role in enabling personalisation at scale, but it's essential to strike a balance between leveraging technology and preserving the human touch.

Even with automation on the rise, it's that personal connection that truly sets retailers apart.Retailers need to be human.In the near future, choosing the right balance between tech wizardry and the human touch is where companies will play and make a difference.
